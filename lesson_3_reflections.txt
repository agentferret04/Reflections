When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--A remote repository is useful, especially if you don't have your computer with you.  It's also helpful
--if multiple people are involved in the project so that they can modify the code when necessary

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--By pulling your changes manually, you can limit the amount of changes in the branch you have to look at, simplifying your git repository
