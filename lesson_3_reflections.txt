When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--A remote repository is useful, especially if you don't have your computer with you.  It's also helpful
--if multiple people are involved in the project so that they can modify the code when necessary

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--By pulling your changes manually, you can limit the amount of changes in the branch you have to look at, simplifying your git repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forking involves multiple collaborators.
-Cloning can be used to clone someone else's program onto your computer so you can modify it.
-Branches are separate modifications to your code that are different from the main (master)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The biggest benefit is that you can work on it offline when you have no internet access.
